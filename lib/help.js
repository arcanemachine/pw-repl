Common tasks:

Modes (${MODES}) stay on until turned off; the prompt shows the selected tab's: (watch routes:1) pw>.
Each of them on its own, and modes, shows its state and what you can run next.

Times are in milliseconds, as in Playwright, or in seconds with an s: wait .done 30000, or wait .done 30s.

fill for selectors with spaces. mousemove and the other mouse commands act at a point instead. An action
scrolls its element into view first, as Playwright does; profile counts that scroll in the action's step.`,

  },
  video: {
    intro: `A video of what you do in a tab, for someone to watch. Record it from a file of commands sent with
pw-repl send --file, not command by command: the time between commands sent one by one is in the video.

1. Set its size first: viewport 1280x720 (help viewport). Then try the flow without recording, and note
the selectors it needs (#id, text=..., role=...), not snapshot refs: the take starts again from a fresh
page, where the refs are stale.

2. Write the take, one command per line, then run it: pw-repl send --file take.txt (pw-repl help, outside
the REPL, has the rest). Its first lines put the page back as it was before the rehearsal (goto <url>),
so the take does not start from the rehearsal's end. A toast, the cursor and highlights stay up across
page loads: turn off any the rehearsal left (toast off, cursor off, highlight off) before record on.

    goto https://shop.example/support/new
    record on clip.webm
    cursor on #subject
    type #subject Package arrived damaged
    select #area Shipping
    click #send
    wait text Ticket filed
    record off

3. While it records, pw-repl paces it for a viewer (help record): type types at a readable pace (use it,
not fill, for text the viewer should see typed), each action and each highlight is followed by a pause, an element out of
view is scrolled to smoothly, and the video starts and ends on a still page. highlight <selector> draws a
box to point at something, and toast <text> a line of text saying what is happening, up for as long as
the viewer needs to read it. After a step that loads a page, wait for text only the result shows (wait
text ...), not a heading the page always has, and not wait load: a single-page app loads nothing.

record on --steps also saves when and where each step ran, in seconds into the video and its pixels, for
editing it afterwards.

The user's own screen, with their real pointer, takes a screen recorder they run (OBS, ffmpeg -f
x11grab, macOS screencapture -v): ask first. playwright-cli itself is a separate tool that records a
clean browser of its own (here, its video-start is record on).`,

  session: {
    intro: `Server: pw-repl serve also takes commands on /tmp/pw-repl.sock; they show here as [server] lines.

Clients: pw-repl send -c <name> (or $PW_CLIENT) sends as a client of its own. It has a selected tab of
its own, so clients do not move each other's; its commands show as [server:<name>] lines. modes and tab
say which client turned each mode on and opened each tab, and modes off --mine turns off only the
sender's own. Senders without a name share the prompt's selected tab. Other clients' commands can run
between a client's own: its selected tab, and the previous command that wait request and wait load count
from, are its own; a tab's requests, console and watch are shared.

The prompt is pw[serve]> while the server is on and pw> without it. Before it are the modes on in the
selected tab, if any: (watch network:off routes:2 capture) pw>. modes lists them for every tab.

Dialogs are reported and never answered on their own; dialog accept or dismiss answers one, from any client, whoever opened it.

Unknown outcome: a command that timed out after it began acting on the page may or may not have done

    detail: `What a step is: a click, typing (once it pauses), Enter or Escape, a form change, a submit or a
navigation, described by role and name as in snapshot, with up to 5 of the requests it caused under it,
each with its status as in requests (body <#> for one), leaving out scripts and what requests hides. The
REPL's own fill shows as type. A double-click shows as two clicks; hovering and moving the mouse are not
recorded. When other elements are described alike (cards that repeat their buttons), the step says which
one: (under "<its nearest heading>"), with n of N where the heading does not settle it.

Privacy: what is typed is recorded, and watch and watch save show it, except in a password field: one
that was ever type=password, or whose autocomplete is for a password, a one-time code or a card number.
--no-values leaves out every value. --changes leaves out field values, but what the page itself shows
(e.g. "Hello <name>") is shown. watch save's file can be read by its owner only.

Saving (watch save): a goto to where the watch started, then each step as a command, under a # line
describing it: click, fill, select, check, press, and wait load after a step that loaded a page. An
element is found by its data-testid, its role and a piece of its name (role=button[name*="Save"]), its id,
name attribute or text; else by an id a framework made up, which another render can number
differently, or its place in the page, which a change to the page can break. A field changed again before
anything else was done (a date picker stepping through days) is filled once, with its last value. After
the app changed its URL without loading a page, the next step waits up to 30s for its element first, as
the new view may take longer to draw than an action waits. A select step chooses the option by its value. What was typed into a password
field (or any field, with --no-values) is a variable named after the field, e.g. fill '#password'
"{{ PW_PASSWORD }}": run it with PW_PASSWORD=... pw-repl send --file login.txt, and send passes the
value along for the REPL to put in, which shows the line as written. A step that cannot be a command (a value with a line break, an element in a frame, or
one no selector finds alone) stays a comment saying why, and the save says how many there are. The file
ends with the last step, not with what it brought: to end on a result that comes later (search results
loading), add a wait for it at the end (wait text ...).

Watching someone: read a response body over 100 KB that matters as soon as it shows in requests, since
the browser drops it once the tab navigates. watch leaves out images and other static files, failed ones
too; console error and requests --all show what failed. Without a url-part, --next-tab takes the first
tab anyone opens: check tab and info once it fires, since another tab opening later does not show in
watch.

Shared: every client sees the same steps, and watch new's place is shared: when another client watches
the tab too, read it with watch <n>, since each one's watch new would hide steps from the other.`,

after the tab navigates, even when the page navigates as soon as the request answers.

--live: a step cut short by the next one, or by watch off, prints at once; changes it made then show
under the next step.

--changes: each element once, with the first names inside it. Not for navigations: what a page changes
on its own after a step settles (data arriving later) shows under the next step.

--next-tab: it takes --changes, --live and --no-values too; watch off stops waiting, and modes lists it. One tab is
waited for at a time: while one client waits, another's watch on --next-tab is refused, and its watch
off leaves the wait on.

watch save: a submit is left out, since the click or Enter that caused it is there. So is a URL the app
changed without loading a page (history.pushState or replaceState), as a comment: the step before it
changes it again. A click on a label that holds its control is the control's click, as it passes it on;
one on a label that names its control with for= is the label's, since that can be a control anywhere
(the first of a page's repeated ids), and a for= label on a checkbox toggles it rather than checks it.

viewer should see typed. Send the take as a file of commands (pw-repl send --file take.txt), or the time
between commands is in the video. help video has the whole way through.

seconds into the video, and the element or point it acted on (or highlighted), in the video's pixels. Use it to find a

frame as the page draws, and a still page keeps its real length. The size is made even (an odd width or
height loses a pixel), scrollbars included; a phone's under emulate mobile is its CSS size: a Pixel 7's
is 412 wide, less sharp than the phone draws it.

How it ended: record on its own, or record off when nothing is recording, says how your last recording
ended (record off, its time, its tab closing or the REPL stopping) with what record off would have
said. tab close says what became of a recording it ended. A REPL stopped with pw-repl stop cannot be

    detail: `For "the page feels slow": what the tab's main thread was busy with, and when. It is a Chrome
performance trace, as DevTools' Performance panel records (Playwright's browser.startTracing), summed up.
Use it around something you do (profile on, click e5, profile off), or while the user uses the page: steps
they take in the browser are in it.

The summary: main-thread busy time by kind (scripting, style/layout, paint, GC, other); the page's
load marks, when it loaded; each long task (over 50ms), with what set it off, the script it ran, the
function it spent most time in ("most in"), each as file:line function, and a big response (100 KB or more) that finished just before
it; forced style and layout (work a script waited for, reading a size or a style), by where in the script; and the steps:
each click or key press with its time to the next paint (input delay, handlers, presentation), and each
burst of wheel or scroll events and each drag, with the main thread's busy time and the frames drawn and
dropped. Times are from when it started. --all lists every long task and step, not the first ones.

Long tasks read kind, what set it off, script: scripting, click event, app.js:120 handleClick. The kind
is what most of its time went to (GC, style/layout); what set it off is the event or callback that began
it (timer, promise callbacks); promise callbacks a click handler queued run in the click's task, so
show as click event. No script is named when none of its code came from a page URL.

A page that freezes: profile on, then do what freezes it. Your commands wait for the page meanwhile, and
may time out, but the profile records it all; profile off once the page answers again.

Size: a busy page fills Chrome's trace buffer in under a minute (one that restyles many elements as it
draws, sooner), which stops the profile there, and the summary says so. Stopping a long one takes a
while, as Chrome writes out its trace: give send time, pw-repl send -t 60s profile off. If send gives up
first, the profile still ends, and profile shows it.

One profile runs at a time, in a browser: Chrome traces one at a time, the whole browser's, so another
REPL's profile, or DevTools' Performance panel recording, stops profile on. It belongs to the tab, ends
if the tab closes (profile shows it), and modes lists it.`,
    moreAbout: 'what is left out, inlined functions, frames in a background tab, and the mark it leaves in the page',
    more: `The tab's own renderer only: a cross-site iframe running in a process of its own is left out, and
so is anything another tab of the same site, sharing the tab's process, does at the same time.

Frames: a tab pw-repl uses is kept drawing as if it were in front (help tab), so its frame counts are a
tab in front's; one behind another tab draws far less, as the user would see it. The summary says so.

A function the JS engine inlined into its caller counts as the caller, in "most in" and --cpu alike: a
small hot function called in a loop can show as the loop's function.

A wheel-zoom or drag the page handles in its own script (a map) shows as a step from its events; one the
browser handles alone, with no listener, may show only as frames.

A page gets scroll events for any scroll, input or not. Those next to a click or key press, with no wheel
event (an action's scroll into view, or a handler's scrollTo), are that step's: it says the page
scrolled. A burst of scroll events alone may also be the page's own script scrolling.

A step under way when the profile began (an action still running at profile on) reads before, without
its busy time: the trace has nothing from before it began.

profile on and off each run console.timeStamp in the page, which prints nothing, so the tab is found in
the trace even when its page did nothing. The trace is kept in a temporary folder until the next
profile, or until the REPL stops.`,
