const USAGE = `Usage:
  pw-repl run [--launch [--headed]] [start-url] [-- <chromium flags>]
      connect to the browser and open the prompt

  pw-repl serve [--background] [--launch [--headed]] [[-e] endpoint] [start-url] [-- <chromium flags>]
      the same, plus a command server (socket, port, or 127.0.0.1:port; default /tmp/pw-repl.sock);
      --background runs it detached, with its output in a log next to the socket

  pw-repl attach [-e endpoint]
      see everything a background REPL does, and type commands to it; Ctrl-C leaves it running

  pw-repl stop [-e endpoint]
      stop a background REPL, and say what became of each recording it ended; its socket is removed, its
      log stays

  pw-repl send [-e endpoint | -s session] [-c client] [-t seconds] [--no-vars] <command...> | --file <file>
      run one command in a running REPL and print its output; --file runs a file of them, one per line

  pw-repl where [-e endpoint | -s session]
      say which REPL send would reach

  pw-repl help [topic | command | --all]
      this usage; with a topic or command, the REPL's help for it

  pw-repl skill
      print an agent skill (SKILL.md) that teaches an agent to use the REPL

send uses the server when -e, $PW_ENDPOINT, or the socket ($PW_SOCKET, default /tmp/pw-repl.sock) is
there, and the tmux session (-s, $PW_TMUX_SESSION, default pw-repl) otherwise. If the socket exists but
nothing answers, send fails rather than fall back. serve without an endpoint serves on that same one:
$PW_ENDPOINT, then $PW_SOCKET, then the default.

send -c <client> (or $PW_CLIENT) sends as a client of the REPL's with a selected tab of its own, so
several agents can share one REPL; pw-repl help session has the rest.

send exit status: 0 ok, 1 command error, 2 completion not confirmed, 64 usage or unreachable. send -t is
how long send waits for the answer (default 20s); it does not lengthen a command's own limits, such as
the 5s an action waits for its element.

send --file <file> runs each line of a file as a command, in order, as if typed at the REPL's prompt:
quoted as the prompt reads it (no shell), with a file it records, uploads or saves relative to this
folder, as on send's command line, and # comments and blank lines skipped. It stops at the first
command that fails, saying its line, with its exit status. -t is each command's own limit. Other
clients' commands can run between its lines, on their own tabs.

A {{ PW_NAME }} in a command, or in a line of the file, is a variable: send takes its value from its own
environment (PW_NAME) and passes it along with the command, not in it, e.g. a password kept out of the
file and out of the command as the REPL logs it. In a file: fill '#password' "{{ PW_PASSWORD }}",
run with PW_PASSWORD=... pw-repl send --file login.txt; or one command: PW_PASSWORD=... pw-repl send
fill '#password' "{{ PW_PASSWORD }}". Only names starting PW_ are variables: any other {{ ... }}, as in a
page's template text, is sent as written. In a file, put it in double quotes: there its value is
escaped as they read it (in single quotes, which escape nothing, a value with a ' is refused). The REPL
puts it in only as it runs the command, and its pane and log show the command as written. A variable that
is not set stops the command, or the file at that line, before it is sent. --no-vars sends
{{ PW_NAME }} as it is. Variables need the command server (pw-repl serve), not the tmux pane.

The browser must be running with --remote-debugging-port (default http://localhost:9222; set $PW_CDP_URL).

--launch is the quick start instead: it starts a Chromium of the REPL's own (headless unless --headed, in
a temporary profile, on a free port of its own, which pw-repl where names), prints the command it ran,
and stops it with the REPL (Ctrl-C while it starts too); stop returns once that Chromium has exited.
Flags after -- go to it; a --user-data-dir=<dir> among them is used instead of the temporary profile, and
kept. PW_CHROME picks which one. To set a browser up your own way, start it yourself and use PW_CDP_URL.

In a tmux session named pw-repl, pw-repl send reaches pw-repl run without the server.`;

const REPL_HELP = `The REPL's own commands: help at the pw> prompt, or pw-repl send help here (no REPL needed).

pw-repl help <topic | command [--all] | --all> shows one part of it; pw-repl help video and pw-repl
help playwright-cli are guides.`;
